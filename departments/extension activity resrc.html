<p><I><B>Extension activities of a university provide a link between the University and the community.<br>
 Extension has always been an integral part of Banasthali University. The origin of Banasthali, itself speaks loads about it.


<p>Before the inception of Banasthali University in 1935, the village was deprived of all basic amenities, let alone literacy.<br>
 Banasthali started a number of programmes under the guidance of Pt. Hiralal Shastri and Smt. Ratan Shastri in the village which involved self 
 reliance through khadi movement,<br> medical relief, social and political awakening and to bring out girls from their
 homes to provide them general education which in itself was a stupendous task.


<p>Since getting the status of Deemed to be University in 1983, Vidyapith is continuously working with the aim of extension and community
 welfare through its various curricular/co-curricular /extra curricular works.<P> Through using different techniques such as dialogues, 
 folk media, recreational activities, interactive and participatory programmes,<br> group working & group discussion, we are continuously 
 trying to create awareness among masses about their rights, access to information, <P>exploitation, discrimination, employment opportunities. 
 Our Education/ Research/Extension are based upon the basic human values <P>to help individuals/families and community as a whole to lead a 
 successful life in changing our neighbourhood society which is also the surviving strength of Banasthali University.</I></B>
