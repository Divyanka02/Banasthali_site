A noteworthy development in this direction has been&nbsp; the recent&nbsp; sanction of a Centre for Research in Mathematical Sciences to Banasthali University by the department of Science &amp; Technology, Government of India. Such Centres are few, probably one or two in the country.

Banasthali&nbsp; provides platform in the form of organizing regional and national level workshops, seminars, conferences and symposia in various disciplines. Similarly the faculty members are encouraged and given full support to participate in various National and International fora. Besides these, there are several other ways in which expertise available is extended to personnel in and outside the Banasthali University. For example, workshop camps for training in Fresco painting are annually held during summers on campus wherein very eminent painters also participate.</span></span>
