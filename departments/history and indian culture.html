	The main thrust areas of teaching in the Department at the postgraduate level are
Modern Indian History, Regional history of Rajasthan and historiography.<p> The
Department aims at teaching of history objectively with an inter-disciplinary
approach.<p> The students are initiated to develop insight into the complexities
of history and to correlate them with the latest trends of historical writings.

read the latest books and journals on the subject and to writen term papers.
<p>This objective is further realized by furnishing the Central Library with good

research accomplishments in the syllabi of postgraduate and undergraduate
