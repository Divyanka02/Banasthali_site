	<P><h4>ICSSR sponsored Ten Day Research Methodology Workshop in Social Sciences for Ph.D. Scholars (9-18 March, 2016).
<br>Department of Sociology, one of the oldest departments, came into existence in Banasthali Vidyapith since 
its inception.
<br>The department has been offering courses at various levels since a very long 
time. The courses are designed to strike a balance between tradition and 
modernity.<br> It aims to promote understanding among students on the contemporary 
complex patterns of social behaviour, thus enabling them to achieve success in 
their life. 
The department offers courses at B.A., M.A. and M. Phil. level. There is also 
the provision of Ph. D. course under this department. &nbsp;<br>At UG level, apart from 
theoretical orientation students are also taught practical / behavioural 
subjects like mass communication, rural and urban sociology,<br> social 
anthropology, research methodology, social demography etc. At the PG level, 
apart from core subjects, <br>students are taught about new trends in sociology like 
sociology of health and medicine, globalization, popular culture and women 
studies etc.<br> 

For the purpose of knowledge enhancement and better career prospects,it has 
also started a PG Diploma course on, &lsquo;Women &amp; Human Rights<br>&rsquo;. The department is 
closely associated with Women&rsquo;s Studies &amp; Research Centre launched in 2005 under
 the support of University Grants Commission (UGC),<br> and 
organizes various activities in collaboration with the centre.

<p>Under the auspice of Student body, Sanskriti, <br>the department provides a platform 
for the students to share their ideas and views on varied social issues. 
Activities like debate, extempore,<br> speeches, quiz, essay and other academic and 
cultural programmes and competitions, are regularly organized for active 
participation of students from varied <br>disciplines.
