			Chemical Engineering Department  is one of the premier engineering departments of 
			Banasthali University. It has a dynamic and goal oriented group of faculty well 
			supported by experienced technical staff. The Department offers instructions at 
			undergraduate level leading to a 4 year B.Tech degree.The instruction at the 
			undergraduate level aims at providing the students a broad- <br>based education with 
			emphasis on theory and practice of Chemical Engineering, keeping <br> in views the 
			current and future requirements of the country.<br> Students are encouraged to 
			identify industrial problems. In-plant training in industrial <br>organizations is a 
			part of the regular undergraduate curriculum. In addition to the <br>infrastructural 
			facilities, pilot plant sized equipment as well as advanced instruments are 
			available.<br> These serve the multiple purposes of training the undergraduate 
			students as well as carrying out research work for final application to solve 
			industrial problems.
			<p>The department is also planning to propose a postgraduate level M.Tech program in 
			Chemical Engineering.<br> In which students will be trained to assume independent 
			responsibilities laying emphasis again on the country&rsquo;s current and future 
			requirements in industry, R&amp;D organizations, design firms and academic 
			institutions.&nbsp; The Department is well equipped for carrying out basic and 
			applied research leading to the degrees of M.Tech.
			</p>
			Scope and job prospects Chemical engineers are expected to have employment growth of more than 8 percent 
			over the projections decade, about as fast as the average for all occupations. <br>
			The most employment growth for chemical engineers will be in service-providing 
			industries such as professional, scientific, and technical services, 
			particularly for research in energy and the developing fields of biotechnology, 
			nanotechnology and environmental awareness.
