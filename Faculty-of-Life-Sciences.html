						The Chemical Engineering Department is one of the premier engineering departments of Banasthali University. It has a dynamic and goal oriented group of faculty well supported by experienced technical staff. The Department offers instructions at undergraduate level leading to a 4 year B.Tech degree. The instruction at the undergraduate level aims at providing the students a broad-based education with emphasis on theory and practice of Chemical Engineering, keeping in views the current and future requirements of the country. Students are encouraged to identify industrial problems. In-plant training in industrial organizations is a part of the regular undergraduate curriculum. In addition to the infrastructural facilities, pilot plant sized equipment as well as advanced instruments are available. These serve the multiple purposes of training the undergraduate students as well as carrying out research work for final application to solve industrial problems.<br><br>

						The department is also planning to propose a postgraduate level M.Tech program in Chemical Engineering. In which students will be trained to assume independent responsibilities laying emphasis again on the country’s current and future requirements in industry, R&D organizations, design firms and academic institutions.  The Department is well equipped for carrying out basic and applied research leading to the degrees of M.Tech.<br><br>
						
						Scope and job prospects<br>

						Chemical engineers are expected to have employment growth of more than 8 percent over the projections decade, about as fast as the average for all occupations. The most employment growth for chemical engineers will be in service-providing industries such as professional, scientific, and technical services, particularly for research in energy and the developing fields of biotechnology, nanotechnology and environmental awareness.
