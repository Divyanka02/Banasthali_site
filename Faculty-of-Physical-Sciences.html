			<h2><p>Apaji Institute of Mathematics & Applied Computer Technology (AIM & ACT) is the faculty of Mathematics, Computing and related disciplines, i.e., IT, Statistics. Over the past thirteen years, it has earned the reputation of one of the important national centers for research and education in its constituent fields. The range of programs offered by the faculty and research in the institute show that a complete synergy is attained in various disciplines in terms of courses offered and research outcomes.<br><br>

			The world class infrastructure and highly qualified faculty of the institute attract students from all over the country. The institute has representation in all national and many international conferences, seminars, workshops, and regularly organizes such activities. It has to its credit a large number of R&D projects sponsored by national bodies and industry. The industry placement has been consistently very good where students from all disciplines are hired on campus by major IT companies of India and are offered the best of the salaries offered elsewhere.

						Mathematics is the music of mind and it attracts people of finest minds in the world. It is the backbone of all sciences. If a  question arises  like which came first in human civilization  - Mathematics or Language? Certainly the answer is Mathematics. If we go back to the begining of stone-age civilization we can see that people used to count their domestic animals by using different stones, and they used body languages to express their mind.<br><br>

						If we study Vedic Mathematics then we can find that the most important number 'Zero' was discovered in India. One of the important irrational like  'Pie' was discovered by the great Indian Mathematician Aryabhatte (476 - 550 AD), who was born in Patliputra in Magadh.<br><br>

						Today there is no nobel prize in Mathematics but International Mathematical Union (IMU) offers Fields Medal once in every four years during International Congress of Mathematicians. (ICM) which is equivalant to nobel prize.
